I worked on this project to practice my Laravel, database, Bootstrap, and CSS skills.
On my way I practiced blade's layouts and partials.
As a second step I added live search, and changing CSS on the go (for logged in users).
I've modified the sidebar to display the user's initials when minimized.
By this point I find web development to be fun!
